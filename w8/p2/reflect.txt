1. In this function we convert the lbs into kgs, there are two cases the first one is
when there is no value stored in the kg variable so when we calculate the value of the
kgs using a constant variable and then alot the variable to the kg using value and then
in the other case where there is a variable stored in it then we use the same method to
 get kgs but just this time we alot the variable to kg using address of the variable we
 can create two more cases like this:
a.
double convertLbsKg1(const double* lbs, double* kg)
{
	double i;
	i = *lbs / CONVERT;
	return(i);
}
b.
double convertLbsKgs2(const double* lbs, double* kg)
{
if (kg != NULL)
	{
		*kg = *lbs/CONVERT;
	}
return (kg);
}

2. In this week's workshop i have used multiple functions in which i am calling other 
functions where i had done some calculations and returned the values and now i am using 
their values to be printed in the displaying function for example convertLbs where i am 
calling convertLbsKg and convertLbsG to store the outputs another example is
calculateReportData where i am using convertLbsKg, convertLbsG, calculateServings and 
calculateCostPerServing where i am using the valriables stored in their funtions to be 
called and utilised to store them in a new variable which are then called in the function 
displayReportData which is used to print the data in table format. And there is the start 
function which is used to call the functions and run the funtions in a loop and then take 
multiple inputs and later at the end of the funtions the same vaues are used to print as 
an output. 

3. I have used the concept of header file for the first timein my life it was a little 
tough at first but as and when i started working on the workshop i slowly got a grip on 
it and by the time I was on the second part of the workshop i could easly use it. I think 
that this feature is quite useful in this field then we can create a minimum of three 
teams who can work of one single project without creating any confusion like the first 
team can work on the main body like how the output will look like and the second team 
can work on the calculations and displaying the functions and calculation function 
and the thrid team can work on the header file where they can work on creating macros 
and functions. I have used many funtions which are used for calculating the convertions 
and the displaying functions as well which reduced the size of my main file and also made 
it easier to understand another reader or fellow members and understand the concept. For example struct CatFoodInfo and reportData and i have also used any function to display the 
functions displayCatFoodHeader, displayCatFoodData, displayReportHeader and displayFinalAnalysis and i have also used many calculating functions like calculateCostPerCal, calculateCostPerServing, calculateServings, convertLbsKg, and convertLbsG now i can just call the function in my main body by just mentioning the header 
file at the top.
